                                                                                                                                                       Plastic managemant in colleges

Plastic waste has emerged as one of the biggest environmental concerns adversely impacting soil, water, health and well-being of citizens at large. Excess-consumption of plastic combined with limited waste disposal systems has become a challenge to urban waste disposal systems and has choked rivers and water systems in rural areas.
The University Grants Commission has issued guidelines for banning plastic use in higher educational institutions under the ‘Swachhta Hi Sewa’ campaign and city-based colleges have already started taking steps in this direction.
“Time has come for a systematic campaign to reduce the usage of plastic, especially single use plastic…The educational institutions have the unique spread and influence to educate students and households on the need for avoiding usage of plastics,” reads the circular issued by the UGC.

Steps taken by some colleges till now:
->Dr Dharam Singh Sandhu, Principal, SCD Government College, said under Swachhata Hi Sewa (SHS) 2019 campaign, the NSS, NCC units and all students of the college led a drive to make the campus free from plastic.He said: “Gandhi ji with his message of cleanliness and non-violence is an inspiration for the youth and we should imbibe his example.”
On Friday, students of Khalsa College for Women in a bid to make the campus free of polythene bags, made use of old and discarded jeans and advocated fellow students to go for cloth bags instead of polythene ones.
->Government College for Girls has kept separate dustbins for dry and wet garbage. Students are regularly made aware regarding the usage of these dustbins and also encouraged to adopt the same policy of segregation of waste at their homes. Students are also made aware of the negative aspects of adopting plastic in day-to-day life.
->Sidak, a student from Khalsa College for Women, said they were working hard to eliminate plastic from the campus and every student was putting in an effort.“I have stopped using polythene bags and if any shopkeeper offers me the same, I decline it and carry my own cloth bag. In addition to this, I have made it a habit to carry my own steel water bottle, so that I do not have to buy water from outside. Small efforts can lead to big achievements and we all need to start putting small efforts to make our future better,” she said.
->The Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) has started a new initiative among students called 'Zero Plastic Starts with Me,' to create awareness about the dangers of plastic at an early age.Under this initiative, students will be directly involved in managing plastic wastes. Each student will have to fill a plastic bottle with plastic waste products like chocolate, or biscuit wrappers.




solutions for managing plastic wastes :
->minimise consumption of single-use plastics
->recycle all plastic waste and ensure correct management of waste
->support the economy and our supply chain to move towards the removal of single-use plastics and implementation of alternatives
->deliver world leading research to provide robust evidence about the environmental problems associated with plastic, thereby helping society tackle the global challenge of moving towards a plastic free society
->raise awareness within the University as well as externally about the issues associated with single-use plastics and waste generation and promote behaviour change.

how to create awareness among students?
We can create awareness by creating local community engagement workshops, organizing beach clean-ups, promoting plastic-free products, lobbying with local and national governments, and speaking at public events  in colleges.
