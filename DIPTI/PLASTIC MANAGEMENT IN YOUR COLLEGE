Introduction
The number of plastic waste has increased by more than 250% since 1970. Every year, the ocean carries about 100 million tons of plastic into its depths and eventually into our food chain. This causes serious environmental problems such as damage to marine life and a threat to human health.

remove the plastic
If you want to make a change, it's time to start thinking about how we can reduce the amount of plastic pollution in our oceans and on land. This is a big challenge because plastic is everywhere—in our homes, workplaces and even on people's skin!

Plastic isn’t just bad for the environment; it can also be harmful for humans. The chemicals used during its production (like phthalates) have been found in many products including food packaging, children’s toys and household items like shampoo bottles. These chemicals are known endocrine disruptors that interfere with hormones such as estrogen or testosterone by mimicking them in the body so they can mimic human hormones too!

Plastic isn't great for us either: it takes hundreds years before recycling processes break down plastics into their original components again which means most waste ends up in landfills where it slowly contaminates soil over time if not burned off completely first (which produces even more greenhouse gases).

manage the waste
The use of dustbin is the most effective way to manage waste. Dustbins should be cleaned regularly and students should also be encouraged to use them. In order to encourage students, you can give rewards such as points for using a dustbin or other incentives like discount on books if they do so.

clean up the area
Once you've removed all the plastic, it's time to clean up. You can use a hose or bucket of water and some soap. This will help remove any dirt or debris that may have stuck to the plastic bits.

use of dustbin
You should use the dustbin and keep your place clean and neat. The teachers will be happy to see that you are following the rules of sanitation in your college.

throw away in dustbin
Once you have finished your work and are ready to go home, it's time to clean up. It's important not only because you want others in the community to know that you are environmentally conscious, but also because it helps prevent accidental injuries from occurring when students leave campus for class or practice their sports on the field.

To help keep things tidy after classes have ended and before late night partying takes place, we recommend using a bin located in front of each classroom or office building as an area for disposing of trash and recyclables before leaving campus grounds each day. This will ensure that no one steps on any leftover items left behind by previous classes or offices after they've gone home!
